In the worst case, we have to do n/m jumps and if the last checked value is greater than the element to be searched for,
 we perform m-1 comparisons more for linear search. Therefore the total number of comparisons in the worst case will be
 ((n/m) + m-1). The value of the function ((n/m) + m-1) will be minimum when m = √n. Therefore, the best step size is m
 = √n.
